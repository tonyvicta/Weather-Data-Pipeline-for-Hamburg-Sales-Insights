# Project Overview: Weather Data Pipeline for Hamburg Sales Insights
Client: A global food truck company operating across multiple countries.

As a Data Engineer supporting my client’s analytics team, I was informed of an unusual sales pattern: sales in Hamburg, Germany dropped to $0 for several days in February. To assist the data analysts in understanding the root cause, I was tasked with two key objectives:

1. Investigate the sales drop in Hamburg

2. Design and build an end-to-end data pipeline that keeps analysts continuously informed about weather conditions in Hamburg

Objective
To determine if external factors—such as weather—played a role in the sales disruption and to ensure the analytics team has up-to-date weather data moving forward for informed decision-making.

Solution
I developed an automated data pipeline that:

- Ingests live weather data from a public API

- Transforms and stores the data for analysis

- Makes the information accessible for analysts via downstream tools

This pipeline enables ongoing monitoring of Hamburg’s weather conditions, allowing for quick cross-referencing with sales anomalies and ensuring the business can respond proactively to similar incidents in the future.
